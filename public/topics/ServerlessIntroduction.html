<h1> What is Serverless ?</h1>
<blockquote>
    <pre>
    <b>Common Question</b>:
    Are there no more servers ?

    <b>Answer</b>:
        No, there are still servers involved. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6scjyj/serverless_is_just_a_name_we_could_have_called_it/"> “Serverless” is just a name. We could have called it “Jeff”</a>.
        Serverless brings a shift in responsibility for developers. To no longer be involved in the management and configuration of a server.
        Doing so allows for more time to be invested in implementing any addition to the application.
