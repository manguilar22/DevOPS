<h4><a href="https://github.com/manguilar22/EuclideanDistancePY">Euclidean Distance Problem</a></h4>
<blockquote>
    <pre>
    Performed euclidean distance algorithm on self-made registry of locations. Locations are in GPS coordinates in diffrent
        formats. Degree, minutes, and seconds; which is a standard. This format is then converted to decimal degree notation
        to ease the computation resources that will be used. After the algorithm completes it makes a new registry with one location
        directed to the shortest path available. Visualizations are also performed on the location using libraries -- seaborn and plotly.

    <pre>
    A finance project using Java's Spring Framework. Spring is a framework that takes into consideration best practices.
    The focus is to write code, in a <b>loose-coupling</b> pattern. This allows for the application to scale up or down,
    depending on the <b>dependency injection</b> allowing for modularity.
